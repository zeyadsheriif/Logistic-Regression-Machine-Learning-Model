# Logistic-Regression-Machine-Learning-Model

Project objectives:  

1-It will work with the Heart Attack dataset.

2-Perform data cleaning steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features as needed.

3-Implement a logistic regression model from scratch without using any pre-built libraries for the model itself. You can use libraries like NumPy or Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.

4-Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

5-Train your logistic regression model on the training data.

6-Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

7-Discuss your observations about the dataset, any challenges faced during data cleaning or model implementation, and the insights gained from the model's performance.
